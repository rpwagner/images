The Serverless Image Data Repository contains datasets of
randomly-generated images. 

(The names of the datasets and images are also random.)

## Data Access

This repository demonstrates how to host dataset files in Globus collections while
providing a publicly available site for data discovery. [Here are the
notes](gcs-deploy.html) on setting up the Globus Connect Server and
[Guest Collection](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=385d3079-5121-40bc-a52f-055296497631&origin_path=%2F).

The site is
hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) a free service
that can deploy sites written in Markdown. Because the Globus
collection hosting the datasets provides HTTPS access, images from the
collection are embedded in catalog pages. 

This site represents the catalog, with metadata about the catalog
itself and the datasets in the repository. The catalog is completely
public while the datasets are grouped into three levels of access:

- [Public](#public-access)
- [Accept Terms & Conditions (All Users)](#accept-terms--conditions-register)
- [Moderated Access (Restricted)](#moderated-access-restricted)

### Public Access

Public is completely public, including anonymous access via HTTPS. 

### Accept Terms & Conditions (Register)

Accept Terms & Conditions means that a user must join the the [Serverless Data
Users](https://app.globus.org/groups/260da91f-3496-11ed-b941-972795fc9504/about)
Globus Group, provided they accept the terms & conditions. All Globus users
can join the Group without any actions by repository personnel. This is the “just sign
up” model where joining the Group provides a list of registered users.

### Moderated Access (Restricted)

Moderated Access means that the user can ask to join the [Serverless
Data Project
One](https://app.globus.org/groups/cf9d1f5b-3496-11ed-b941-972795fc9504/about)
Globus Group, but a group manager must approve members. This is the
“request access” model.

To support datasets with different access requirements, datasets could
be gather into folders with access tied to various Globus Groups. This
also allows different projects to curate access to their
datasets, where PIs or their delegates can be assigned as Group
managers. Then they receive and decide on access requests.

## Prior Art

An inspiration for this concept is the [X-ray Tomography Data
Bank](https://tomobank.readthedocs.io/). TomoBank uses a Globus
collection at Argonne to store files and publishes descriptions of its
datasets on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org). Because the
dataset metadata is on Github in the [TomoBank
repo](https://github.com/tomography/tomobank), users can submit new
datasets through pull requests.
